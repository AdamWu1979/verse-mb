# Multiband RF pulse design for realistic gradient performance

## Content
This repository contains code to produce MBv and vMB examples.
The VERSE code used is an modified version version of https://github.com/mriphysics/reVERSE-GIRF by Shaihan Malik, which in turn
is an implementation of Time-optimal VERSE pulse design [(Lee et al, 2009)](http://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.21950). This has been implemented by modifying code released by Miki Lustig for designing time-optimal gradients, publically available on the  [authors' website](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/Software.html). 

Therefore, acknowledgements to the time-optimal gradient framework should be attributed to [Lustig IEEE-TMI 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18541493) whilst acknowledgement to time-optimal VERSE goes to Lee et al 2009.
